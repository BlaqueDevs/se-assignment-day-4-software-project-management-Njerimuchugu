   5. Regular monitoring and reporting; use tools like Jira,Trello or Microsoft project to track expenses and milestones .Set regular budget reviews.
   6. Contingency budgeting; allocate 10-20% of the total budget for unforeseen issues or risks.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology;
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility,collaboration and customer feedback. Projects are divided into small units called sprints typically lasting 1-4 weeks, allowing continuous reassessment and adaptation throughout the project lifecycle.
Advantages;
1. Flexibility and adaptability; changes can be made even late in the development process.
2. Continuous feedback; stakeholders and users can review progress regularly and suggest improvements.
3. Faster delivery; working software is delivered frequently allowing quicker responses.
4. Improved collaboration; Agile promotes teamwork and regular communication through stand ups and reviews.
5. Higher quality; continuous testing and integration help catch issues early.
   Disadvantages;
   1. Less predictability; it can be hard to estimate time and cost upfront .
   2. Scope creep risk; since changes are encouraged projects can expand beyond original plans.
   3. Requires commitment; teams need to be fully engaged and available which can be demanding.
   4. Documentation may suffer; Agile focuses more on working software than detailed documentation.
      Waterfall Methodology
      It is a linear and sequential approach. The project flows through defined phases-requirements,design,implementation,testing,deployment, and maintenance with each stage completed before moving to the next.
      Advantages;
      1. Clear structure; the step by step process is easy to understand and manage.
      2. Well defined requirements; all requirements are gathered upfront leading to fewer changes later.
      3. Predictable timelines and budget; since everything is planned at the start it's easier to estimate costs and time.
      4. Thorough documentation; each phase is well documented which is useful for future reference.
         Disadvantages
         1. Inflexibility; changes are difficult and expensive once the project is underway.
         2. Delayed feedback; stakeholders don't see the product until late in the process which can lead to dissatisfaction.
         3. Risk of rework; if requirements are misunderstood early fixing mistakes later can be costly.
         4. Slow to deliver; no functional product is available until the final stages.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is more beneficial;
Agile is ideal for projects that;
-Have changing or evolving requirements
-Need frequent user feedback
-Require flexibility and adaptability
-Involve continuous delivery of working components
Examples of projects best suited for Agile;
1. Mobile app development;user preferences evolve quickly.Agile allows for frequent updates,feature changes and improvements based on user feedback.
2. Startups developing new products;startups often operate in uncertain environments.Agile lets them experiment, pivot and release MVPs(minimum viable products) quickly.
3. E-commerce platforms;online shops need to adapt to trends, customer behaviour and integrate with many APIs.Agile helps teams release updates regularily.
4. Custom software solutions for clients; when the client's needs may evolve during development, Agile's iterative cycles keep them involved and the product aligned with expectations.
   When Waterfall is more beneficial ;
   Waterfall works best for projects that;
   -Have fixed well defined requirements
   -Are heavily regulated or require strict documentation
   -Have clear scope, timeline and budget
   -Do not expect major changes during execution
   Examples of projects best sited for Waterfall;
   1. Construction projects(e.g building a bridge); requirements and designs are set in stone from the start.Safety, compliance and budget must be precisely followed.
   2. Government or defense software projects;these often require strict documentation, audits and compliance with fixed specifications.
   3. ERP System implementation in a stable organization; if the company has clear unchanging business processes, Waterfall may be more efficient to deploy large systems.
   4. Medical device software; high level regulations and safety concerns require detailed upfront planning, documentation and validation making Watefall more suitable.                                         
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for ensuring Quality Assurance in a software project;
